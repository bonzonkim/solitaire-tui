## 1. Summary

No specific research was required for this feature.

## 2. Rationale

The problem domain, Klondike Solitaire, is well-understood and its rules are publicly documented. The technology stack (Go, Bubble Tea, Lip Gloss) is pre-determined by the project constitution, and its application for a TUI game is straightforward.

All necessary decisions could be derived directly from the feature specification and the project's existing architectural patterns.
